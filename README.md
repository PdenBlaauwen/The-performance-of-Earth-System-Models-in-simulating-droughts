# The-performance-of-Eart-System-Models-in-simulating-droughts

Welcome to the Github repository for my master thesis, "The Performance of Earth System Models in Simulating Droughts". This repository contains codes that were used to analyze the performance of different Land Surface Models (LSMs) in simulating droughts in six different study areas: East Brazil, West Africa, Central US, Southeast Australia, East US, and East China.

Within the Earth System Models, the focus was on the Land Surface Models. East Brazil was the first study area, so the code may not be as concise as the code for the other study areas. The sixth location (East China) contains the best template for new locations and the most concise code.

Each study area has three files:

The file that ends with "monthly" or "essentials" is the main file that focuses on the performance of the LSMs through various evaluation steps. The "essentials" file is the summary of the more elaborate "monthly" code. 
The mrsol file looks at the soil moisture output of the LSMs.
The SoMo.ml file looks at the reference observed soil moisture data.
